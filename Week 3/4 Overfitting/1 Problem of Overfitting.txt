Underfit
---------
When the hypothesis does not fit the training data very well, it's underfit.
For eg, House price increase with size but will eventually lean more towards Size.

In such a scenario, a linear hypothesis will have high bias.
It means the algorithm has a very strong preconception or a bias that housing prices are going to increase linearly with size and despite the data to the contrary.

Overfit
----------
On the other hand, if the hypothesis seems to do a very good job of fitting each and every training example, it means the data is overfitting.
In such a scenario, hypothesis will have high variance.
The term high variance is another historical or technical one. But, the intuition is that, if we're fitting such a high order polynomial, then, the hypothesis can fit almost any function and this face of possible hypothesis is just too large, it's too variable. And we don't have enough data to constrain it to give us a good hypothesis so that's called overfitting.
Problem of overfitting will come, if we have too many features. The learned hypothesis may fit the training set very well[h(sub θ)x - y ≈ 0], but will fail to generalize to new examples. 



The Problem of Overfitting
---------------------------
Consider the problem of predicting y from x ∈ R. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a y = θ₀ + θ₁x to a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good.

Instead, if we had added an extra feature x², and fit y = θ₀ + θ₁x + θ₂x², then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a 5ᵗʰ order polynomial y = ∑ j = 0..5 θⱼxʲ. 
We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas (x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of underfitting—in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of overfitting.

Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h(sub θ) maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. 
At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.

This terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:

1) Reduce the number of features:

Manually select which features to keep.
Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).

2) Regularization

Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters θⱼ.


Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.
