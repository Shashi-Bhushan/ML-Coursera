Supervised Learning
=========================

Supervised Learning problems are generally of two types.

# Classification

y(i) ∈ { a finite set of values}


# Regression

y(i) ∈ R Ɐ real numbers

=========================
Unsupervised Learning
=========================

Given (x¹, x², .... xⁿ), find patterns in the data.
No Target Variable Given here, on the basis of which to Distinguish data.

Eg. Music with two voices, Database of DNAs, a Collection of photos
all these are examples of unsupervised learning problems, where it's not given that on the basis of which target varibles, the data should be classified.

# Clustering

We have some points in 2-D real space. Your task is to find cluster in the data.
A collection of photos and segregating those photos on the basis of if they are front bumper or rear bumper etc are clustering.
