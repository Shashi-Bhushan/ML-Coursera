Gradient Descent
=========================

Gradient Descent is an algorithm used to minimize the cost function J().

# How

We have Cost Function J(θ₀, θ₁)

we want to minimize θ₀ and θ₁

# OUTLINE

- Start with any value of θ₀ and θ₁.
  We will choose θ₀ = 0 and θ₁ = 0 to start.
- Keep changing values of θ₀ and θ₁ until we find a minimum Cost

Starts at a point
Keep going downhill until you reach a point of local minimum value.

If I use another point in the plot as my starting point, I might reach a new local optimal solution.
