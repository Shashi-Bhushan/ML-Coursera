Unlike the previous Section, we are going to keep both the parameters θ0 and θ1 now.

Now, when we want to Plot our graph for J(θ₀, θ₁), we can not draw this on a 2-Dimentional graph.
Because there are 2 Parameters θ₀ and θ₁ w.r.t which we want to draw the graph.
So, it will be a 3-Dimentional graph.

=========================
Bivariate Cost Function
=========================

The height of the bow shaped graph from the place θ₀, θ₁ represent the value of the cost function.
We intent to have the bow as close to the plane as possible.

=========================
Contour Plot
=========================

A contour plot is a graph that contains many contour lines. 
A contour line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line. 

The center of the contour plot is where the cost function value is minimum.

In the graph, we have chosen a point where θ₀ = 800 and θ₁ = -0.15.
Now, these values represent the current Hypothesis function.
As you can see in the graph as well as the value of the cost function being far away from the center, this is not the optimal value of θ₀ and θ₁ for the solution.


In the second example, we choose θ₀ = 360 and θ₁ = 0, so our hypothesis function becomes h(x) = 360 + 0 * x.
This value is much more close to the center of the contour plot. Hence, it's cost function value will also be lesser than the previous one.

What we want is a program, that calculates the values of θ₀ and θ₁ which results in minimum value for the cost function.
