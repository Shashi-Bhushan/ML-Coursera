Simplified Cost Function

I have a cost function and my goal is to minimize Cost function J(θ1, θ2) for a given θ1, θ2 value.

Now,
	hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1(x)
if i choose θ0 as 0, then 
	hθ(x) = θ1(x)

For, x = 0, hθ(x) will also be zero. Line for hθ(x) will pass through the origin.

Also, our cost function will become 
	J(θ1) = (1/2m) ∑i=1 to m [ θ1(xi) − yi ]square

Now, our goal is to minimize J(θ1) or simply θ1.


				hθ(x)							|						J(θ1)
												|
	For a fixed θ1, This is a function of x.	|			This is a Function of parameter θ1.
												|
 	If i take θ1 = 1, then for all values of x 	|		For θ1 = 1, as h(x(i)) = x(i)
 		hθ1(x(i)) = θ1x(i) = x(i)				|				J(θ1) = 0
 		i.e. h(x(i)) = x(i)						|
