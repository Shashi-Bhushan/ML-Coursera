θ = (XᵀX)⁻¹XᵀY


==============================
∇ₐtr(AB) = Bᵀ

Suppose we have some fixes matrix B ε Rⁿˣᵐ 
We can then define a function f : Rⁿˣᵐ |→ R according to f(A) = tr(AB).								-- (1)
f(A) = 3A₁₁ + 2A₂₂ ...

if A ε Rᵐˣⁿ, then AB is a square matrix (m by m) and we can apply the trace operator to it.
f indeed map from Rᵐˣⁿ to R as it's input is a matrix A(B is a fixed/constant matrix) and output is a number.

So, ∇ₐf(A) will be a m by n matrix.
	= ∇ₐf(A) = Bᵀ
	= ∇ₐtr(AB) = Bᵀ		-- from (1)
